Assignment 06 - The Matrix and his happy fellows
===================

This time, we ask you to use template class/function to build up a set of classes for Matrix and Vector operation.

Please follow my detail illustration in the course and 
read ***Hw6_The_Matrix_and_his_happy_fellows.pdf*** carefully.

The provided codes are impossible to be compiled directly, please find the way to complete it and make it compilable. BTW, There are a lots of comments in the provided codes, please follow them to add your own codes. (You could find most of grading policy in these comments)

----------

There are at least five files need to be submitted: (s1234567 is just a example of student ID)

s1234567hw6_Main.cpp (My_Main.cpp) > the driver program

s1234567hw6_Vector_Base.hpp (My_Vector_Base.hpp) > The Base class of Vector

s1234567hw6_Vector.hpp (My_Vector.hpp) > Derived classes of Vector

s1234567hw6_Matrix_Base.hpp (My_Matrix_Base.hpp) > The Base Class of Matrix

s1234567hw6_Matrix.hpp (My_Matrix.hpp) > Derived classes of Matrix

s1234567hw6_Matrix.inl  (My_Matrix.inl) > Inline functions of My_Matrix.hpp 

In the end, please follow rules strictly. (Include 作業繳交規範 by 徐皓)

**Due date:  6/20 (Sat.)**

----------
A common workflow of preparation of your homework
-------------
(In the following text, we assume your student ID is s1234567 and # is the NUMBER of homework in one digit, Please replace it with your student ID and follow the steps exactly!)


1. Clone your private repository of hw# to your home directory on server or another suitable location from our organization on GitHub (https://github.com/YZU-CSE-CS114-Computer-Programming-II)

2. After you start to deal with your homework, add a file s1234567hw#_main.cpp as your main program and s1234567hw#_report.md as your report (optional). Then, commit it! **(Don't forget to push it onto GitHub, too)** 
**Any of your code should be prefixed with "s1234567hw#_"**.

3. Complete your program and write your report (if necessary) with Markdown.
*. Please commit your homework when you have any progress (The project should be compilable 可編譯).

4. Make sure you have complete the assignment and prepare a clear demo in your report. **Do it ON YOUR OWN and ON TIME.** (You have **only 2 chances in this semester** to request additional time for doing your homework, each chance will give you additional **24Hours**. Please contact the TAs **BEFORE** the deadline and use it wisely)
