Assignment 04 - the Big one with your own Vector
===================

To enforce your skill of programming, we ask you to rebuild the `class` ***HugeUInteger*** with your own ***Vector*** class. This homework is highly similar to 2nd midterm in the 5/9. If you are not familiar with it, please attend our class to figure out the details.

There are five files need to be submitred: (s1234567 is just a example of student ID)
s1234567hw4_main.cpp (midterm_2nd.cpp) > the driver program
(the new outputs of drvier programe had been added into comments of each line of codes
new: output of testing codes of ***Vector*** class)

s1234567hw4_Vector.h (PG2Vector.h) > your own Vector class
s1234567hw4_Vector.cpp (PG2Vector_partial.cpp) > partial implmentation

s1234567hw4_HugeUInteger.h (PG2HugeUInteger.h) > similar to hw1
s1234567hw4_HugeUInteger.cpp (PG2HugeUInteger_partial.cpp) > partial implmentation

***NOTE***: use `std::vector` is NOT allow in the homework

In the end, please follow rules strictly. (Include 作業繳交規範 by TA)

**Due date:  5/21 (Thu.)**

----------
A common workflow of preparation of your homework
-------------
(In the following text, we assume your student ID is s1234567 and # is the NUMBER of homework in one digit, Please replace it with your student ID and follow the steps exactly!)


1. Clone your private repository of hw# to your home directory on server or another suitable location from our organization on GitHub (https://github.com/YZU-CSE-CS114-Computer-Programming-II)

2. After you start to deal with your homework, add a file s1234567hw#_main.cpp as your main program and s1234567hw#_report.md as your report (optional). Then, commit it! **(Don't forget to push it onto GitHub, too)** 
**Any of your code should be prefixed with "1234567hw#_"**.

3. Complete your program and write your report (if necessary) with Markdown.
*. Please commit your homework when you have any progress (The project should be compilable 可編譯).

4. Make sure you have complete the assignment and prepare a clear demo in your report. **Do it ON YOUR OWN and ON TIME.** (You have **only 2 chances in this semester** to request additional time for doing your homework, each chance will give you additional **24Hours**. Please contact the TAs **BEFORE** the deadline and use it wisely)
